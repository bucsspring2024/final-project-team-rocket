## Project Description

This will be similar to a simple pokemon game, where a player walks around a fixed area which includes a path and some grass and some fence around the section (where the player can go). If the player walks into the grass for more than a set amount of time, they will engage in a pokemon battle where their pokemon uses moves against another pokemon. I will include the battle menu and everything like that. I plan on making the map fixed while the player can move for this game but may change that later.
